## Contributions

For a list of available tasks please look at the open issues. I try to keep them up-to-date.<br/>

### Code Formatting
For C and C++, please use the clang-format file under `extra-tools`. You can also just skip that and use some common sense.<br/>
For Python, Lua and Haskell, just your common sense. Don't cram your lines into 80 characters. Please don't.<br/>

### Write Tests
If you are adding a feature or functionality please also include the tests. all tests go into the test directory under ptoject root inside a folder with the same name as the executable they belong to.<br/>
The travis build is enabled for mutator forks so you can check your pull request's coverage and see whether you have decreased the coverage or not.<br/>

### Issues
For discussions regarding the implementations or feature requests or enhancements please use the repo's issues.<br/>

### Labels
We have quite a varied range of labels for issues. please use them.<br/>

### Contributers.md
Don't forget to add your name to the `Contributers.md` file in the repo root. The list has a chronological order. Don't break that.<br/>
