## bruiser

### What is it?
Bruiser is implemented as an interactive commandline interface. It features an embedded lua interpreter plus the history and auto-completion and suggestion features we have all come to expect from shell-like tools.<br/>
Regarding the actual functionality, it will feature non-blind selective mutations. You can ask it to list information regrading the source codes it is run on. The eventuality of this idea is to help with maintaining code or in giving the viewer an overview of the code. The final feature is the name-sale. It looks at the code and decides how to break it. For more explanation please read on.<br/>

### DSL?
bruiser has an embedded lua interpreter so nobody would have to deal with a new DSL.<br/>

### Non-blind Selective mutation?
bruiser looks at your code, learns your code and then decides how to mutate your code. That's non-blind selective mutation.<br/>

### How?
I'm going to wrire about it as soon as I get my thoughts organized. In the meantime you can look at the source code for some hints.<br/>
